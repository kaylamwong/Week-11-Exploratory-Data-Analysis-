    "- Definition: Object\n",
    "    - An object is a programming abstract representing a single collection of data and methods to access that data treated as one unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Definition: Encapsulation\n",
    "    - Encapsulation is a principle of object-oriented design where direct access to object data is restricted, and object methods must be used to access the data.\n",
    "    - Encapsulation serves to reduce the knowledge needed for a programmer to use an object, and gives the library developer freedom to change the internal data as long as the external methods behave as promised.\n",
    "    - Python, encapsulation is primarily achieved using naming conventions to indicate whether a variable or method is intended for internal use\n",
    "    - Example: Think of encapsulation like a vending machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Bundle (Encapsulation)\n",
    "    - A vending machine is a single, self-contained unit. It bundles two things together:\n",
    "    - Data (Properties): The internal components, like the inventory (what snacks are inside) and the money box (how much cash it holds).\n",
    "    - Functions (Methods): The actions you can perform, like \"insert coin,\" \"select item,\" and \"dispense change.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Control (Encapsulation's Goal)\n",
    "    - When you use the machine, you don't reach inside to grab the snack or the money. You interact only with the interface—the buttons and the slots.\n",
    "    - Hiding the Details: You don't need to know how the motor spins or how the change is counted; all that complexity is hidden inside. This is a form of Abstraction, which works hand-in-hand with encapsulation.\n",
    "    - Protecting the Data: The internal inventory and money are protected. You can't just take the snacks or change the price on the fly. You must use the official method (select item) to interact with the machine's internal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Definition: Attribute\n",
    "    - An attribute is a label or other piece of data associated with an object.\n",
    "    - Attributes often are written with syntax as if they directly access an object's internal state, but some languages including Python can optionally override that direct access with special methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Definition: Method\n",
    "    - A method is a function associated with an object that runs with the object as part of its context, and usually has privileged access to the object's internal data.\n",
    "    - Much of the programming in this module with expressions like my_array.sum() or df.plot() uses methods."

    "*To make writing large, complex, and long-lasting programs easier and more reliable* \n",
    "\n",
    "- Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "Procedural Programming: Divides a program into functions, with data (variables) and functions operating on the data separate from one another [00:15]. This can lead to \"spaghetti code\" where functions are scattered, code is repeated, and changes in one area cause unintended breaks in others due to high interdependency [00:41].\n",
    "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Solves this problem by combining a group of related variables (properties) and functions (methods) into a single unit called an object [01:04].\n",
    "\n",
    "The Four Core Concepts of OOP: \n",
    "1. Encapsulation (reduces complexity and enables reuse by grouping related items)\n",
    "- This concept involves grouping related properties and methods into a single object [01:50].\n",
    "- Benefit: Functions within an object can access the object's properties without needing them to be passed as parameters, leading to functions with fewer parameters, which are easier to use and maintain [02:42].\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction (hides complexity, shows essentials, and isolates the impact of changes)\n",
    "- Abstraction is the idea of hiding the complex internal details and showing only the essential parts of an object to the outside [03:36]. (E.g., pressing the 'play' button on a DVD player without knowing the complex internal logic.)\n",
    "- Benefits:\n",
    "    - It simplifies the object's interface, making it easier to use and understand [04:03].\n",
    "    - It helps reduce the impact of change; if internal (or private) methods are changed, those changes do not leak to the outside code [04:10].\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance (eliminates redudant code)\n",
    "- This mechanism allows you to define properties and methods once in a generic object and have other, more specific objects inherit them [04:40].\n",
    "- Benefit: It eliminates redundant code by reusing common features across related objects [05:14]. (E.g., various HTML elements like text boxes and checkboxes inheriting properties and methods from a generic HTML element object.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism (helps refactor complex switch-case statements)\n",
    "- From Greek, meaning \"many forms\" (poly = many, morph = form) [05:33].\n",
    "- Polymorphism allows objects to share a common method name, but have each object implement that method differently [06:06]. (E.g., different HTML elements each having a render method, but each rendering itself differently).\n",
    "- Benefit: It allows developers to avoid long and complex if-else or switch statements, leading to cleaner code [05:36]."

    "    - Multiple inheritance is when a class is directly derived from more than one other class.\n",
    "    - Not all languages allow multiple inheritance, since it can make some programming details tricky. Python allows multiple inheritance, but has some sanity checks for incompatible combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Definition: Base class (the parent)\n",
    "    - A base class is a class from which other classes were derived.\n",
    "    - Sometimes, we might refer to the base class of an instance, referring to the base class(es) of the class specifically used to create an instance.\n",

    "Write better-organized, more reusable, and more scalable code using the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm.\n",
    "- Simply put, classes are essential for moving beyond simple scripts to building large, complex applications and software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Benefits of Classes\n",
    "1. Structure and Organization (Encapsulation)\n",
    "- Classes allow you to group related data (variables, called attributes) and the functions that operate on that data (called methods) into a single, neat package.\n",
    "- Example: Instead of having separate variables like car_color, car_speed, and a function change_speed(color, speed), you create a single Car class. All related information and actions are kept inside the car object, making the code easier to manage. This concept is called Encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reusability (Inheritance)\n",
    "- Classes allow you to define a general set of features once and then reuse those features in more specific, related classes. This is called Inheritance.\n",
    "- Example: You can define a Vehicle class with general methods like start_engine(). Then, you can create a Truck class and a Motorcycle class that inherit all the methods from Vehicle. You only have to write the general start_engine() code once. This drastically reduces duplicate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Real-World Modeling\n",
    "- Classes are a powerful tool for modeling real-world concepts in your code. You define a blueprint (the class) and then create many independent, working instances (the objects) from that blueprint.\n",
    "- Example: In a video game, every enemy, weapon, and player character is an instance of a class. In a banking application, every account is an instance of an Account class, each with its own unique data (balance, account number).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Required for Libraries\n",
    "Many of the most popular and powerful Python libraries—especially those used in data science, web development, and machine learning—are built using classes.\n",
    "- You must understand classes to effectively use tools like:\n",
    "- Pandas: DataFrames are instances of a class.\n",
    "- Scikit-learn: Every model (e.g., LinearRegression, KMeans) is a class you instantiate and use.\n",
    "- Django/Flask: Web frameworks use classes extensively for views and models."
